	[!] Notification de-duplication support
	[!] Add confirmation dialog system from CSwitch
	[!] Add Dear ImGui support
	[ ] Space Partitioning

		[ ] Parse non-dense nodes in .pbf
		[ ] Serialize to .pbf
		[?] Option to dump directly to file through DataStream for TwoPassPrint functions
	[!] Async loading of background image (single worker thread?)
	[ ] Load file(s) as layers
	[ ] Filter by tags UI, render if filtered items are below limit, save only filtered items
	[ ] Choose which background image to use
	[ ] ResizableSplit based on px not percent
	[ ] Store things in dictionaries based on IDs for quick lookup by ID
	[ ] Caching system with eviction for vertex buffers

	[ ] Choose which name(s) to display for all nodes
	[ ] Space partitioning data structure
	[ ] Layer management panel (create, destroy, duplicate, move between layers, etc.)
	[ ] Render names on ways (or collections of ways?)
	[ ] Dynamically show node names based on importance and position to maximize space usage
